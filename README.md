## Note:
Aside from the CysticFibrosis collection, all of the original files (and some explanations) are available at http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test_collections/.

### CysticFibrosis Collection Disclaimer:
There were a few issues with the original files, mostly to do with encoding. These were manually altered before parsing.
- cf74: line 6860 had some unreadable characters, so I filled in the blanks (I believe I found the original abstract/extract).
- cf74: line 9554 (the final line) was all garbage so I removed it, doing so did not alter the total documents counted.
- cf75: line 11739 had the same issue as above.
- cf79 line 13622 also had this issue.
- cf79 lines 9120-9144 were formatted to fit the rest of the documents, but the contents were not changed.
